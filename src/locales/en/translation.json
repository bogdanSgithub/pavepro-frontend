      "description": "We begin by killing all unwanted weeds and vegetation, removing stains (oil, rust, mildew, etc.), and thoroughly extracting the old, loose sand from between the pavers. This step restores the surface and prepares it for the next stage."

      "title2": "Sand",
      "description": "Next, we refill the joints with high-quality polymeric sand, ensuring a solid, weed-resistant bond. The sand is then watered to activate its binding agents, which help lock the pavers in place and prevent shifting."

      "title2": "Seal",
      "description": "Finally, we apply a premium sealer that not only solidifies the sand but also enhances the appearance of your pavers with a rich, clean finish. The sealer protects against stains, UV damage, and water infiltration, giving your surface a long-lasting, beautiful look."
